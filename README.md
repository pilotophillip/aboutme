# About Me 👋

Welcome to my "About Me" project — a personal website I built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to introduce who I am as a developer, creator, and human being.

This isn't just a portfolio — it's a reflection of my passions, values, and the code principles I stand by.

 I originally created this project before starting my software engineering bootcamp at TripleTen, showcasing the skills I gained through self-teaching and consistency. Later, I enhanced the project with clean code principles and best practices I learned during my bootcamp.

## 🔍 What's Inside

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 About Me
From being a proud husband and father to embracing my journey as a self-taught software engineer, I highlight four key pieces of who I am:
- Family comes first — they’re my motivation and strength.
- Basketball keeps me grounded and focused.
- Building LEGO sets helps me unwind and think creatively.
- Software engineering is where I bring my ideas to life.

### 🧼 Clean Code Rules
This section walks through the coding standards I live by:
- ✅ Consistent formatting
- 🧠 Simplicity & clarity
- ♻️ Reusability through modularity
- 📝 Thoughtful documentation

### 🎧 Best Songs to Code To
I embedded my personal Apple Music playlist — Lo-Fi Chill — to share the soundtrack behind my daily grind. Because good code deserves good vibes.

### 🧪 My Projects
